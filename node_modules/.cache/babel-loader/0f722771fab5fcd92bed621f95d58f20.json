Mthree\",\n      position: \"Full Stack Java Developer Trainee\",\n      dates: \"July 2020 - Present\",\n      description: <div>\n        <p>\n          I attended Mthree’s Aspire Scholarship program and its virtual\n          Full Stack Java Development course. In a matter of 3 months, we attained the\n          skills to build fully functional full stack applications. We learned core\n          concepts such as Agile methodologies, Software Development Life Cycle, MVC\n          Designs, CRUD applications, and ACID compliance.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The training program\n          replicated a work environment that consisted of daily stand-ups, weekly\n          assignments for each course module, set hours of 9-5, and working in a\n          consistent Agile workflow.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We started with understanding Java and building\n          MVC designs, then moving on to database tools such as <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>JDBC Template</strong>, and <strong>JPA</strong>.\n          We then explored the <strong>Spring Framework</strong> as well as <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and the concept of <strong>RESTful</strong> APIs.\n          Finally, we dabbled on front-end technologies and frameworks, such as <strong>HTML5/CSS/JavaScript ES6</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>Thymeleaf</strong>.\n          And in the last three weeks, we learned to connect the database,\n          back-end, and front-end together to create full stack applications.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    },\n    ftl: {\n      logo: ftlLogo,\n      company: \"Faster Than Light\",\n      position: \"Software/Business Development Intern\",\n      dates: \"June 2019 - August 2019\",\n      description: <div>\n        <p>\n          Faster Than Light is a cybersecurity startup dedicated to providing a fast\n          and easy-to-use online static analysis tool for programmers of any level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Faster Than Light exposed me to what it truly meant to work in a start-up\n          environment. I wore many hats throughout my internship. I performed lots of\n          user testing, many of which provided many feedback about the UI/UX of the\n          startup’s BugCatcher product. I was assigned to think of useful features that\n          could be tailored more towards amateurs and student coders, such as the\n          integration of Github. Everyone in the team did quality assurance tests with\n          every product iteration. I had to relearn Python to help debug the source\n          code of the product. And lastly, I dedicated half of my time to reaching out\n          to online developer communities such as blogs, podcasts, and Meetups for\n          outreach purposes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The three most valuable skills I’ve gained throughout my experience was\n          communication, organization, and teamwork. Because the internship was remote,\n          I made sure to not bombard my boss with questions, since she was always busy\n          with meetings. I only reached out whenever I couldn’t figure out the answers\n          myself. I also made sure to keep a tight schedule, since I constantly had\n          multiple tasks to keep track of. I learned how to be brief and succinct in\n          cold emails. And lastly, I always updated my team with my progress.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    },\n    appstrax: {\n      logo: appstraxLogo,\n      company: \"AppStrax Technology (Pyt) Ltd\",\n      position: \"Full Stack Developer Intern\",\n      dates: \"July 2018 - August 2018\",\n      description: <div>\n        <p>\n          AppStrax Technology is a full stack software development team dedicated to\n          providing technical solutions to its clients.
