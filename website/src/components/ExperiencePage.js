          I attended Mthreeâ€™s Aspire Scholarship program and its virtual
          Full Stack Java Development course. In a matter of 3 months, we attained the
          skills to build fully functional full stack applications. We learned core
          concepts such as Agile methodologies, Software Development Life Cycle, MVC
          Designs, CRUD applications, and ACID compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The training program
          replicated a work environment that consisted of daily stand-ups, weekly
          assignments for each course module, set hours of 9-5, and working in a
          consistent Agile workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started with understanding Java and building
          MVC designs, then moving on to database tools such as <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>JDBC Template</strong>, and <strong>JPA</strong>.
          We then explored the <strong>Spring Framework</strong> as well as <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and the concept of <strong>RESTful</strong> APIs.
          Finally, we dabbled on front-end technologies and frameworks, such as <strong>HTML5/CSS/JavaScript ES6</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>Thymeleaf</strong>.
          And in the last three weeks, we learned to connect the database,
          back-end, and front-end together to create full stack applications.
