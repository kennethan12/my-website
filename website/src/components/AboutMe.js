              I am passionate about creating applications that are simple, intuitive, and tailored to user experience.
              Although backend implementation is where I am most comfortable, I love to pursue front-end challenges
              and observe them as learning opportunities. I also love to work in teams, receive help from others,
              and assist them back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I love to make music, browse food pictures on Instagram, mess around with my dog, and work out.
