            I am passionate about creating applications that are simple, intuitive, and tailored to user experience. 
            Although backend implementation is where I am most comfortable, I love to pursue front-end challenges 
            and observe them as learning opportunities. I also love to work in teams, receive help from others, 
            and assist them back.
          </p>

            Outside of coding, I love to make music, browse food pictures on Instagram, mess around with my dog, and work out.
